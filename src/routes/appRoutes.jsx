/**
 * This file defines the application's routes as a list of <Route> components.
 * 
 * Each <Route> specifies a URL path and an element (component) to render when that path is accessed.
 * 
 * Naming convention:
 * The `routes` variable is named in lowercase because itâ€™s a standard variable, not a React component.
 * 
 * This file is saved as .jsx because it contains JSX syntax, indicating that it handles JSX and React components.
