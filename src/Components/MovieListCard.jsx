    /* Hover Effect and State Changes:
    The isHovered state is initially set to false using useState(false).
    When the mouse enters the article (.movie-list-card), onMouseEnter event is triggered, calling handleMouseEnter function.
    handleMouseEnter sets isHovered to true.
    This state change triggers a re-render of the component.
    Elements inside the article that use the visible CSS class will now apply their styles because isHovered is true.
    Conversely, when the mouse leaves the article, onMouseLeave event triggers handleMouseLeave function.
    handleMouseLeave sets isHovered to false using setIsHovered(false).
    This state change triggers another re-render of the component.
    Elements inside the article that use the hidden CSS class will now apply their styles because isHovered is false.
    Placing the hover event handlers (onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave) on the article (.movie-list-card) ensures that the hover effect is triggered when the mouse is over any part of the article.
