# Movie Site Project

This project was about building a multi-page React application displaying movies from an API.

### The Problem

Key challenges included implementing dynamic routing for individual movie pages and managing API data using React hooks. Trying out using React router was a bit tricky to understand first since I wanted to make a separate component for the routes. The styling was handled with styled-components, where I solved layout challenges like creating hover effects and animations. A particular challenge was implementing the movie details page with proper state management and creating a nice experience with the back button.
