# Movie Site Project

In this project we are fetching data from an API to showcase popular movies and their details. Designed with at focus on resonsiveness and accessibility.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

First was reading and watching the material for this week and examining the instructions.

The basic structure was set before we split up the components that was needed in order to make the project work.

The problems we had was how to implement the structure with the error and loading part into the movie- and movieDetails components. To solve this problem we googled a lot and used chatGPT.

I there had been more time, the next step would have been to implement a sorting/filtering function and to add a better and more good looking rating design.
