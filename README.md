# Movie Site Project

This app displays the most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDB). Data is fetched from the TMDB API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to dynamically show popular movies and their details. The site is built with React, using React components to structure the app, and React Router to navigate between different pages.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

This project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to handle its dependencies and run the development server.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
Before deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

### The Problem
1. Deploying to Netlify.  
In this project, I stored the API key (and token too at first) used to fetch data from TMDB in a .env file for security reasons, and the file is added to .gitignore to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub. When deploying the app on Netlify, environment variables from .env files are not automatically transferred, so the data from the TMDB database couldn't be fetched. To resolve this, the API token was manually added to Netlify's environment variables under Site Configureation > Environment variables > Environment variables. The API key is available in production without being exposeds in the code.  

2. Default and named exports  
I mixed them up a few times, and tried to import default exports as named.  

3. Renaming components  
Initially, I named the appRoutes file as AppRoutes.jsx, assuming it was a React component. Later, I learned that itâ€™s not a component but a JavaScript file so it should follow camelCase naming (appRoutes). When I attempted to rename the file from AppRoutes.jsx to appRoutes.jsx, I encountered issues that I couldn't resolve myself, so I used ChatGPT which suggested a temporarily renaming the file to something entirely different (like RoutesTemp.jsx) before renaming it back to appRoutes.jsx. This solved the issue.  

4. Styling   
I spend too much time on the styling (the hover effect that refused to work).  

### If I had more time
1. I would fix the movies that have broken images.   
2. Add more styling to the route for MovieInfo.  
3. Fix the hover effect to fully work. 
4. Split up the styling into different files.
