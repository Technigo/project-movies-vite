# Movie Site Project

This project focuses on building a movie site using the themoviedb.org API. Users can browse movies now playing and upcoming movies and click on a movie to view details, and navigate seamlessly across pages thanks to dynamic routing and responsive design.

I started off by structuring the app into different components and pages and thought about what could be reusable. The app is structured into modular components like Navbar, MovieCard, and reusable UI elements such as Moviegrid and Typography. Pages include Home, NowPlaying, Upcoming, and Movieinfo, each fetching data from the API. Routing is managed through App.jsx, with a custom NotFound page for unmatched routes.

### The Problem

My primary challenge was integrating dynamic API data with a responsive and accessible design. It took me a long time to style it so it became responsive.

The tools and tequniques that I have used is React for the user interface, React Router for dynamic routing, Fetch API to retrieve movie data and styled components for the CSS.
