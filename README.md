# Movie Site Project

Create a movie site. Build multi-page React application and use a API. 

### The Problem

I did a css file for each component to keep things more tidy and easy to manage. The added an array for the movies. To make the text more accessible/readble I add gradient to increase the contrast between foreground and background element. Tested in lighthouse and got 88%. Replaced display none with opacity 0 and the got 100 on lighthouse.
