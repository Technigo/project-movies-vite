# Movie Site Project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

#### Development Process:

I set up the basic project structure, implemented routing using React Router, and created placeholder components for each page. I used Git for version control and implemented loading spinners and error messages to provide a better experience for the users during data fetching.
