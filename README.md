# Movie Site Project

Creating a site that displays movie releases using themoviedb.org's API. 

## The Problem

We used a Figjam board to plan the project then we created the components and functionality of the page together. For the styling we worked in branches and each styled one page. If we had more time we would add more endpoints from the API and also make the user able to select from different endpoints.
