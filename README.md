# Movie Site Project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem
We started by doing the movielist and then the details. Since there was a specific layout to follow we did it structurally component by component. We used the react router for the first time. If we had more time we would've done the error page and also multiple pages in the start (like a headermenu with different choices)
