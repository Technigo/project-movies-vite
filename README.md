# Movie Site Project

This app displays the most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDB). Data is fetched from the TMDB API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to dynamically show popular movies and their details. The site is built with React, using React components to structure the app, and React Router to navigate between different pages.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

This project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to handle its dependencies and run the development server.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
Before deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

### The Problem


### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
