# Movie Site Project

Assignment: Create a movie website that allows users to browse and view details about movies.I've added some extra to my projects, browsing even tv series and displaying reviews.

### The Problem

I defined the scope of the project, including the specific functionalities required for browsing movies and TV series, as well as displaying reviews.Integrated with movie and TV series APIs to fetch data including titles, posters, ratings,release dates. Additionally, integrated with a review API and TopRatedMovies API.
Considering additional features that could be implemented in the future, such as browsing within a search-bar, add trailers and streaming providers links.
