# Movie Site Projectüé¨üçø
Welcome to the Movie Site Project! This is a pair programming. The project is aim to create our own movie site. We've built the first multi-page React application and use a fun new API from the database https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started.

## Getting Started with the Project
Huadan and Isa collaborated on the initial codebase, dividing responsibilities for different sections. Huadan focused on the MovieList component, while Isa took charge of the ShowMovie component. With daily communication and regular morning stand-up meetings, the team effectively coordinated their efforts.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

- During the development process, some challenges were encountered, particularly during the pair programming phase. Ensuring seamless collaboration and effective communication was vital. Coordination in managing code integration and addressing conflicting programming approaches were crucial aspects that demanded attention. However, through efficient teamwork and constant communication, these challenges were successfully resolved, resulting in a robust and well-integrated application.
