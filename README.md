# Movie Site Project

The goal for this week was to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.  This project was carried out through pair programming with my teammate So Youn.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i 
code .  
npm run dev
```

### The Problem

* Setting a background image using template literals in React -
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-background-image-tutorial-how-to-set-backgroundimage-with-inline-css-style/

* Instead of designing a loading page, my teammate recommended `react-loader-spinner` library to install.

* Deploying Vite plugin in Netlify requires the css files to be written in camelCase compared to jsx files in PascalCase.

* Deployment issues on Netlify having its own rules on entry points:

    `netlify.toml` file created with the following code written within:
      ```[[redirects]]
          from = "/*"
          to = "/index.html"
          status = 200
      ```
    securing the API token generated by themoviedb within `.env` with the following code:
    ```
    VITE_NAME_CHOSEN= yourApiKey
    ```
    included itself in `.gitignore` to remain untracked and adding it as an environment variable for netlify deployment.  Note: I had to generate a 2nd key and untrack the `.env` as the commits were already pushed earlier, so the 1st API key shown in the github repo is invalid - not considered to be a security breech anymore.

* Debugging the code was tricky for my part as I was working on the 2nd page that was fired from the homepage being created simultaneously by my pair programming teammate -intricacy.  Some team members joined in to lend a helping hand.  The communication, synchronous and asynchronous, went smoothly as several meetups were regularly organised during the week.
