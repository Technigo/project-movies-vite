# Movie Site Project

This is a project for creating a movie site that displays popular movies and their details. 

The project uses the The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data.

### The Problem

The challenge for this project was to implement React Router to create routes for each movie's details page. We used React.js to create the site and fetch data from the TMDb API. We also used CSS to style the site and make it responsive.

If we had more time, we could add more features to the site, such as ability to filter movies by genre.
