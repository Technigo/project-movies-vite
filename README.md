# Movie Site Project
This project is a responsive movie site that showcases popular films and detailed information about them. It utilizes React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and fetch data dynamically from a movie API. Users can explore movies by category, search for specific titles, and view individual movie details in an engaging, interactive interface. The project demonstrates skills in handling asynchronous data fetching, component-based architecture, and responsive design.
