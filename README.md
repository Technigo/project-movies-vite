# Movie Site Project

Pair Project
Michael Holm and Ayumi Gorbacheva-Yamamoto

The assignment was to build a multi-page React application by creating a movie site using The Movie Database API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

The project was initially started with Preeti Vadali, but she unfortunately had to drop out of the project. Preeti and Ayumi started by creating an initial structure together which Michael then refactored for better efficiency and dynamic routing.

We used React Router Dom which we learned about this week and the along with the included hooks such as useParams and useNavigate. We also continued to build on the hooks we learned in previous weeks by using state and useEffect throughout the application.
