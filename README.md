# Movie Site Project

This week we worked in pairs and the goal for this week is to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies.
Display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

## Getting Started with the Project

We started to do a brief plan in Figma over what we need in the code.
We started to work on our project in Liveshare in vs code and then split up in branches to do styling.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

we had som problems with fetching the right API id:s to make the right picture to be a poster and the other for the background.
We used the info in notion and google to solve our problems and also looking closely on our code.

It was a bit tricky to make the css behave as we wanted but trying different things back and forth we made it work fine.

We still have a problem with Page not found when refreshing the page after clicking one movie. This we haven't solved.
Otherwise the page works good.
