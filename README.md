# Movie Site Project

The assignment was to build a movies site where the user first see different movies on the homepage and then the user can click on a movie and come to a new page with more detailed info. We used React Router Dom for this project to create pages. 

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We worked with pair-programming and divided the assignment in smaller tasks and we used an API to fetch data from a movie site and we used React Router to build pages.
