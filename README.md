# Movie Site Project

In this project, we put into practice the implementation and usage of react-router-dom, along with its main methods.

### The Problem

The main challenge was to start working on the documentation and the project on Thursday after being sick for more than four days during this and the past week. Despite the setback, I'm really pleased with the results and grateful for being able to catch up with the upcoming weeks.

Given more time, I would have added some sorting buttons, improved loading visualization, and more features.
