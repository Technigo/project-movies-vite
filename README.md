# Movie Site Project

A project that uses themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

First was examining the project instructions and examples and then reading and watching the material for this week.
The project was forked and then a basic structure was outlined before starting. There were some difficulties with routing initially, but they were quickly solved after a lecture demonstrating routing.

A selection of techniques, frameworks and tools used: re HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, React Hooks, API etc.

The number one issue was managing a responsive design that would look good on different sizes of displays without employing too many static values.

If there had been more time, the next step would have been to introduce a sorting function and categories along with a search function for specific movies.
