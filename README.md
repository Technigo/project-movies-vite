# Movie Site Project

This project is a movie site that utilizes the themoviedb.org API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and provide detailed information about each movie on a separate page. It includes features such as responsive design and error handling for invalid movie IDs.

### The Problem

For this project, the approach involved building a React application with multiple components and routes using React Router. The main tools and techniques used include React hooks such as useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects, react-router-dom for routing, and API calls to fetch data from themoviedb.org. The application follows a modular structure with reusable components for displaying movie cards, movie details, and error pages.

If more time were available, the following improvements could be made:

-Implementing additional features such as a dropdown menu or a nav bar to toggle between different lists of movies (e.g., popular, upcoming, new releases).

-Enhancing the loading states with loading spinners or placeholders to provide better user feedback during data fetching.

-Adding a style sheet to the 404-page for better user experience.

-Adding a feature to load more movies in the movies list.
