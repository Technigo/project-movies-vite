# Movie Site Project

Practicing fetching movie data from an API and show popular movies, rendering movie specifics, and managing image URLs. Designed with a focus on responsiveness and accessibility. Enhancements include error handling and dynamic movie lists

### The Problem

Started by looking through the API and it's endpoints and then sketch a layout with the data I wanted to show. Thought of possible components and then started to code, following my layout.

### View it live
