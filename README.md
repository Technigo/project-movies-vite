# Movie Site Project

Project to practise React Route. 

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started by creating the routes and components, and fetched the movie-list and details, which worked well. Problems we encountered was how to get the rating points rounded to one decimal, but after some help from the coding session we got it fixed. We had some layout issues and got good help from a classmate with the viewports. It helped to switch from grid to flexbox.
