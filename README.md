# Movie Site Project

This weeks project was to fetch a list of movies from themoviedb.orgâ€™s API and display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

### The Problem

I worked solo this week and started out creating some pages and components, wrapping the app in browserrouterwith and routes and filled the routes.jsx file with the routes needed. Then I started fetching the popular-movies-data from the API and continued trying to display it. I used Google, earlier projects and ChatGPT to help me figure out how to write the code. I also implemented my first react-spinner-element and imported icons from react-icons. If you had more time, I would try the stretchgoal with implementing a dropdown to change the list.
