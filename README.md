# Movie Site Project

The goal was to use an API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

## The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started as always with the structure and added my components. I also want to keep App clean so I made a routes folder. The hardest part this week was the CSS which I struggled with with overlay. I tried to follow the design and followed guidelines for accessibility.

If I had more time I would try and make loading states which I've never done before.
