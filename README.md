# Movie Site Project

The goal of this project is to make a multi page application using React Router. The home page displays a number of movies fetched from an API and when clicking on one of the movie, another page with details about the specific movie is rendered.

### The Problem

I started by planning which components I would need and where I would make my API calls. I built the app using React Router (BrowserRouter, Routes, Routes, Link) and useParams() to get the ID for the second page.

If I had more time, I would make it possible to go back to the exact same place that the user came from when they clicked a specific movie (same API endpoint and same page), right now they are sent back to the home page.
