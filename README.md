# Movie Site Project

Elin & Olga's Movie Site Project

This week our task was to make a site that displays movies with the use of an API. When the user clicks on a movie, they're taken to a page with the specific movie's details using the React Router.

### The Problem

We started out by figuring out which components we need for our page and which routes we need for navigating between them. Then we shared the components for each of us to build in our own branches, which we then merged and continued working on the main branch.

For this project we opted for only writing CSS in one file, as we though that there won't be so much of it that we would need more files.

After checking off all the requirements of the project, we decided to build a "go back" button that takes the user back to the main page from the movie details page. If we would've had more time, we would like to have made an error page as well.
