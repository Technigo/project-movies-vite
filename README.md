# Movie Site Project

The movie project with React Router is a web application built using the React framework and React Router library. It allows users to browse and explore information about various movies. The project utilizes React Router for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different pages without the need for full-page reloads.

## Getting Started with the Project

### The Problem

In the movie project, the main challenge was to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface using React and React Router. This involved implementing features such as displaying a list of movies, providing movie details on click, and allowing users to navigate between different pages seamlessly.

Some specific challenges included:

1. Implementing a hamburger menu for navigation on smaller screens while ensuring it remains visible and accessible.
2. Styling the movie cards and ensuring they display correctly across various screen sizes.
3. Managing state and handling user interactions, such as selecting different movie options.
4. Aligning and styling elements dynamically, such as positioning the movie details under the poster and ensuring proper padding and layout.
5. Handling transitions and animations, such as moving text slightly when hovering over a button.

Overall, the project required a combination of React skills, CSS styling, and problem-solving to create a functional and visually appealing movie application.
