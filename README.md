# Movie Site Project

Movie single page application (SPA) project,by using the API from https://www.themoviedb.org/. Learned how to use BrowserRouter, Routes, Route and useParams().

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started to layout what components we need and want to create. We also looked into the API what data we'd like to use. At first we code together and tried doing pair-programming for the BrowserRouter, Routes, etc. After a while we split up the work and code in different branches.

We mostly gathered our information from the bootcamp material or the lovely internet. If we had more creativity and time, we would have done de styling different and might have fetched other data from TMDB.

#### Additional

- Add disclamer: "This [website, program, service, application, product] uses TMDB and the TMDB APIs but is not endorsed, certified, or otherwise approved by TMDB."
