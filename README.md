## About the Project

### Technology Used

Below is a list of the key technologies and tools we've employed in this project:

#### React
React is the primary frontend framework used to build this project. It's known for its component-based architecture and provides a flexible and efficient way to create user interfaces.

#### React Router

We've implemented React Router to manage the routing within our application. This allows users to navigate between different pages and sections seamlessly.

#### SWR

SWR, which stands for "stale-while-revalidate," is an essential tool for data fetching in our project. It helps keep data up-to-date and provides a smooth user experience.

#### Node.js

Node.js is used to run the development server. It's a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side, enabling server-side rendering and serving the application during development.

#### Vite

Vite is employed as a build tool in our project. It's known for its fast development and build times, making it ideal for a seamless development workflow.

#### CSS Modules

For styling our components, we've utilized CSS Modules. CSS Modules provide local scope to styles, ensuring that styles don't interfere with each other and helping maintain clean and modular code.

#### Themoviedb API

To fetch movie and TV show data, we've integrated The Movie Database (TMDb) API. This API provides access to a wealth of information about movies and TV shows, making it an essential component of our project.

If you'd like to access the TMDb API for your own project, you can get an API key by signing up on their website: [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

These technologies and tools work together to bring you an exciting and feature-rich movie and TV show exploration experience. Whether you're looking for your favorite movies or discovering new ones, our project has you covered!

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

> The glimpse into our project's potential and where we plan to take it in the future are the following: 

### User Authentication: 

Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts, log in, and personalize their experience. This feature will enable users to save favorite movies, write reviews, and interact with the community.

### Advanced Search and Filters: 

Enhance the search functionality by adding filters such as genre, release year, and ratings. This will help users find movies or TV shows that match their specific preferences more effectively.

### Recommendation Engine: 

Develop a recommendation system that suggests movies or TV shows based on users' viewing history and preferences. This feature can significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction.
