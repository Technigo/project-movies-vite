# Movie Site Project

For this week the focus was to learn about React Router and make a multi-page application using a movie API.

### The Problem

This was a group assignment. Due to different schedules, we have worked in branches but also together using LiveShare. This worked out well for us since we made sure to get everybody up to speed with what work had been done by one another.
This project has been made by Laura Lyckholm, Emmy Dieden and Anna Robertsson.

We started out with making a plan together for the project and laid out what we wanted to have as components. All those components were then made first so that they could be imported in the PopularList-page and the Details-page as they were created after that. We used the MovieDB-API to fetch both the popular movies and then the chosen movie's details and images. We have also added a "Page not found"-page and a loader.

When encountering problems we have discussed them within the group or with other Team Orange-members. We have also looked back at material provided by Technigo or asked chatGPT for help.
