# Movie Site Project

For this assigment we built a movie site with React Router, fetching the data from a movie data base. 

### The Problem

Had a lot of trouble when deploying the site in Netlify - the package.json data was not correct so the building of the site was not working. If we would do more it would be to improve the design.
