# Movie Site Project

The goal for this project was to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when the user clicks on the movie.

### The Problem

I wanted to show movies ordered according to different genres. I also wanted to try how to make a kind of "netflix" style, having the movies scollable for each genre. 
To improve especially the design, it would be good to have more movies for the different genres. The API gives back 20 results as a standard.
