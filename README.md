# Movie Site Project

We did this project with pair-programming, React router and the React router hook useParams(). We used themoviedb.orgâ€™s API to fetch a list of movies and display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. 

### The Problem

We communicated a lot with each other to solve this task, we also used Google, Youtube, Chat GPT and the learning material. We ensured that we deployed the project early in the week so we knew that we would not get any issues with that.
