# Movie Site Project

The assignment was to create your own movie site. Fetching data from an API and creating a multi-page React application.

### The Problem

I started out with looking at the design from Technigo. Then fetched data for both my pages. Tried to keep my code as short and simple as possible. Then finished with the styling which was quite a challenge for me (again). CSS is harder than you think! If I had more time I would like to have done some stretch goals and also played around a bit more with the CSS.
