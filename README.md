# Movie Site Project

The assignment was to produce a site which displays the latest movie-releases. Once a video was clicked, additional information should be displayed. The site was built using React Router.

### The Problem

We did some planning and created the structure. We had only minor coding related problems but learned along the way with the env file and merging branches. We did have some struggles with deploying the site and tried adding and deleting toml file, in the end our problem was a typo in an import and we solved it together.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
