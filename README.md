# Movie Site Project

Build a movie site üçø

This is my first multi-page React application and use a fun new API.

The goal is to list popular movies by using themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies and show details about them on a seperate page by using React and React Router.

## Highlights:

I try to fullfill all the requirements and add a PageNotFound page when users try to visit a movie detail page with an invalid movie ID.

On the homepage where I list Now Playing movies and on mobile screen, I add a dropdown to change the list between popular, top rated and upcomning.

### Future Improvements

Here are several enhancements I‚Äôd like to implement with more time: 

  - Favoratie movie list:
    I would like to add an fav-movie page in the MovieList and complete the stretch goals.

  - Light & Dark mode

  - Search input:
    that user could search for movies from the list
  
  - Play button

  - Handle loading states: streth goals

  - Work on with the style and try to use Styled components in React
