# Popcorn Movie Site

This project is a multi-page React application that uses the TMDB API.

### The Problem

First I layed out the base structure with two pages and its consisting components. I designed the app with a mobile first approach, and then adapted the layout for tablet and desktop. The app is created using React with routes and fetch promises in useEffects.
