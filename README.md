### Movie Site Project
Create a website shows a list of movies using themoviedb.org's API. 

### The Problem
I struggled a lot for CSS.  I could not finish for loading and dropdown to change the list. I will submit for now but will to continue till it works.
To do: 
- Add header & footer
- Update NotFound.jsx
- Update MovieList.jsx
- Loading state
- toggle between popular, upcoming, and new releases
