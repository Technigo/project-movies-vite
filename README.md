# Movie Site Project

The Movie Site project is an application that fetches and displays movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It includes two primary pages: one for listing popular movies and another for showing detailed information about a selected movie.

### The Problem

This project required working with TMDb's API to dynamically fetch and display movie data. The goal was to create a functional, responsive, and accessible app with modular components and dynamic routes.

### Approach

- API Integration: Used fetch to request popular movies and movie details from TMDb API.
- Routing: Implemented react-router-dom for dynamic navigation between the movie list and detail pages.
- Responsive Design: Ensured the app works across devices from 320px to 1600px.
- Accessibility: Followed accessibility guidelines, including adding alt attributes for images and ensuring proper color contrast.

### Technologies Used

- React: Component-based structure
- React Router: Dynamic routing and linking
- CSS: Styling and responsive design
- TMDb API: Fetching movie data
- Lighthouse: Accessibility and performance testing
